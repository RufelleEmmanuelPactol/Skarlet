## **What is Skarlet?**

Skarlet is a **reference-friendly object store**, designed for developers who need speed, simplicity, and intuitive handling of complex data structures. Think of it as a **friendlier version of Redis**â€”one that simplifies storing and managing references while retaining **blazing-fast performance**.

With built-in support for object references and its own form of **data normalization**, Skarlet makes reference-friendly querying a breeze. Its learning curve is minimal, so you can hit the ground running.

## **Core Features**

### **Complex Data Structures**
- Skarlet supports various complex data structures, including **sets**, **lists**, and **dictionaries**.
- These structures make it easy to model complex relationships and nested data scenarios without losing simplicity or performance.

### **Reference Support**
- Skarlet allows you to maintain **references** to other data structures, enabling you to create sophisticated, interconnected data models.
- References facilitate a normalization approach that avoids deeply nested, hard-to-manage structures.

## **Skarlet Normalization Levels**

Skarlet employs a series of normalization "levels" that help maintain a clean, logical data model. These are inspired by normal forms in relational databases but adapted to the key-value and reference-based nature of Skarlet.

**Level 1: Baseline Key-Value Structure**
- **Key-Value Model**: Skarlet stores data as keys and values within a top-level container called a **node**.
- **Nodes as Collections**: Each node resides in the global space and can be treated like a "table" or "collection."
- **Keys**: All keys must be **strings**â€”no exceptions. Keys cannot be complex or primitive other than strings.
- **Values**: Values can be either **primitive** or **complex**. Primitive types (integers, reals/floats, strings, and references) form the baseline data representation.

**Level 2: Structuring Complex Data**
- **Complex Data Types**: Values can include complex data structures like sets, lists, and dictionaries.
- **Primitive Containment**: Complex data types can hold any primitive data type (integers, reals, strings, references) within them.
- **No Complex Nesting**: A complex data type cannot directly hold another complex data type. This restriction encourages clearer data modeling, preventing excessive nesting.

**Level 3: Reference-Based Normalization**
- **References as Primitives**: References are considered a special kind of primitive data type. They can point to other complex data structures or primitive values, acting as links rather than containers.
- **Avoiding Deep Nesting**: By using references, you maintain a normalized structure. Instead of embedding one complex object inside another, you reference it, resulting in a cleaner, more maintainable model.
- **Flexible Linking**: References enable relational-like linkage without forcing rigid schema constraints, combining the flexibility of key-value stores with the organizational benefits of normalized data models.

By following these normalization levels, you can leverage Skarletâ€™s powerful featuresâ€”complex data structures, references, and key-value simplicityâ€”while maintaining a clear, logical, and high-performance data design.

## **Other Features Skarlet Promises**:
- **Better documentation**: Comprehensive and clear, to get you started faster.
- **Better drivers**: Reliable, performant, and developer-friendly.
- **Better reference support**: Seamlessly manage object relationships and queries.
- **Faster than Kasper**: Optimized to perform at lightning speed.
- **More lightweight than Kasper**: Efficient and easy to deploy.

## **What Happened to Kasper?**

Kasper was my first attempt at creating a database during my sophomore year of college. While it was ambitious and innovative at the time, it tried to do too muchâ€”following the footsteps of Redis, SQL, and Neo4j. This led to a **bloated and hard-to-use system**.

Recognizing its shortcomings, I decided to start from scratch. Skarlet is the result: a focused, refined, and vastly improved version of Kasper. It keeps the essence of what made Kasper unique while delivering on the promise of **speed**, **simplicity**, and **practicality**.

## **Why Choose Skarlet?**

Skarlet isnâ€™t just another object storeâ€”itâ€™s a tool designed to help developers work smarter, not harder. Whether you're building a blazing-fast web app, a data-intensive API, or anything in between, Skarletâ€™s focus on **speed** and **reference management** makes it the perfect choice.
